API link: https://amiiboapi.com/api/amiibo/  

Overview & Description of Project 2:
- Design a website with a search engine that links to an API of my choice.
- Project should contain 3 files: index.html, style.css and main.js
- Create custom grid classes in CSS that make use of flex properties for the layout.
- Website should only be displayed on one payge, even though Navbar should be displayed and functional.
- Website should be functional in both desktop and mobile (320px) screens.
- In the mobile version images should stack vertically in a signle column.
- In the mobile version navigation items should stack vertically, as should the site title.
- Use a Google Font that I have never heard of before and use that style on the overall look of the site.

Funtionality of this site:
- This site offers amiibo fans the ability to find the images of cards and/or figurines of their favorite characters.
- This site is attractive to fans of all ages because it offers a variety of images of each character and their representation found in different games, series and time frames.
- This site offers an apportunity for collectors to find out what amiibo characters are missing from their collection or what other characters may have an amiibo that they were not aware of.
- Easily navigate through the character options with the search bar.
- If you are new to the amiibo world you can get ideas of what characters may be available to search with the images found on the background of the website.

Ideas for future improvements:
- A link to pages where you can purchase the amiibo card or figurine desired.
- A link to the official websites with more information about the games these characters are in.
- Creation of a fan club forum where fans can discuss different topics regarding amiibo characters and cards.
- An area where individuals can swap, buy or sell their figurines or cards.
